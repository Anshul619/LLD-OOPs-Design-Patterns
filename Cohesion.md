# Code should be loosely coupled (highly cohesive)
- [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)) refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task.
- A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method.
- The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts.
- The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface.
- However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.
